<p class="regularText">
    Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data Protection
    Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR"), "processing" refers to any
    operation or set of operations such as collection, recording, organization,
    structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, consultation, use,
    disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise making available,
    alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction performed on
    personal data, whether by automated means or not.

<p class="regularText">
    The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular about the
    type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the processing of such data
    either under our own control or in conjunction with others. We also inform you
    below about the third-party components we use to optimize our website and
    improve the user experience which may result in said third parties also
    processing data they collect and control.
</p>

<p class="regularText">
    Our privacy policy is structured as follows:

    <li>II.  The rights of users and data subjects</li>
    <li>III. Information about the data processing</li>
</ul>

<h3>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h3>

<p class="regularText">
    With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail below, users
    and data subjects have the right
</p>

<p class="regularText">
    to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being processed, information
    about the data being processed, further information about the nature of the
    data processing, and copies of the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR); to correct or
    complete incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR); to the immediate
    deletion of data concerning them (cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively,
    if further processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR, to
    restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR; to receive copies of the data
    concerning them and/or provided by them and to have the same transmitted to
    other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR); to file complaints with
    the supervisory authority if they believe that data concerning them is being
    processed by the controller in breach of data protection provisions (see also
    Art. 77 GDPR).  In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients
    to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or restrictions
    placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1, 18 GDPR. However, this
    obligation does not apply if such notification is impossible or involves a
    disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users have a right to information about
    these recipients.
</p>

<p class="regularText">
    Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects have the right to object
    to the controller's future processing of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1
    lit. f) GDPR. In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose of
    direct advertising is permissible.
